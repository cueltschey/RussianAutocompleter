# RussianAutocompleter

### Purpose
I wanted to make an application that would implement a unique data structure. This lead me to an autocomplete bar
since it is something I've needed in past projects. The end result was very satisfying and effective implementation that worked a lot
better than I expected. Feel free to add more featues or use it in your own projects. If you want to adapt the autocomplete to another
data set just fill in the WordsData.db file with new autocomplete suggestions.

### Features
- Uses over 10,000 words to give autocomplete suggestions
- quickly searches for suggestions using a Trie
- The bar can be autocompleted with either Tab or a mouse click on the dropdown
